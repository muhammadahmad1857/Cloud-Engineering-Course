# TypeScript Assignment 02

## Introduction

This assignment consists of several tasks that involve using conditional statements and taking user input to perform various operations such as checking numbers, determining age groups, calculating the number of days in a month, and checking leap years.

## Tasks

1. **Check Number Properties**

   - Determine if a given number is even or odd.
   - Determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, either of them, or not divisible by both.

2. **Voting Eligibility**

   - Take the user's age as input.
   - If the age is 18 or above, ask if they have Pakistani nationality.
     - If yes, print "You are eligible to vote."
     - If no, print "Please obtain a valid ID to vote."

3. **Age Categorization**

   - Write a program that takes the age of a person as input.
   - Determine whether they are a child (0-12 years), teenager (13-19 years), adult (20-59 years), or senior citizen (60 years and above).

4. **Number of Days in a Month**

   - Enter a month (as a number between 1 and 12).
   - Print the number of days in that month. Assume a non-leap year.

5. **Leap Year Checker**
   - Check if a year is a leap year or not.

## Usage

- For each task, run the provided code or create your own program according to the given requirements.
