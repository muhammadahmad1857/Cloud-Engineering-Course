## 1. What is Routing?

Routing is the mechanism through which a web application handles navigation between different pages or views. It maps URLs to the corresponding web pages or components. In modern web development, routing is essential for creating single-page applications (SPAs) that enable dynamic content without reloading the page.

Key aspects of routing include:

- URL parsing and matching
- Handling parameters and query strings
- Managing navigation history
- Implementing redirects and error handling

## 2. How Routing Works in Web 1.0

In Web 1.0, routing was simple but inefficient. Every time a user clicked a link or navigated to a new page, a request was sent to the server. The server then returned a new HTML page, which caused a full-page reload. This approach made the web experience slower because of constant back-and-forth communication with the server for every page transition.

Characteristics of Web 1.0 routing:

- Server-side rendering for each page
- Stateless interactions
- Limited interactivity
- Higher server load due to frequent requests

## 3. What is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "Engine X") is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is widely used for serving static content, load balancing, handling HTTP and HTTPS requests, and acting as a gateway for handling requests in modern web applications.

Key features of Nginx:

- Event-driven architecture
- Asynchronous processing
- Modular design
- Support for various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP)

## 4. What are the Benefits of Nginx?

- **High Performance**: Nginx can handle thousands of connections with minimal memory usage.
- **Reverse Proxying**: Acts as a reverse proxy server to distribute client requests across multiple servers, balancing the load.
- **Security**: Provides SSL termination, filtering, and request throttling to secure applications.
- **Efficient Static File Serving**: Serves static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with high efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle large traffic loads without impacting performance.
- **Caching**: Implements efficient caching mechanisms to reduce server load and improve response times.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various web technologies and can be easily integrated with other tools and frameworks.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization.

## 5. What is Deploying a Website on a Server?

Deploying a website on a server means making the web application live on the internet by hosting it on a web server like Nginx or Apache. The deployment process involves setting up a server, uploading the website files, configuring DNS, and ensuring the website is accessible to users worldwide.

Steps in website deployment:

1. Choosing a hosting provider
2. Setting up the server environment
3. Configuring the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
4. Uploading website files
5. Setting up databases (if required)
6. Configuring domain and DNS settings
7. Implementing SSL certificates for HTTPS
8. Testing the deployed website
9. Setting up monitoring and logging
10. Implementing backup and recovery strategies

## 6. Types of Server Responses

When a server processes a request, it can respond in different formats. These are the most common types:

### HTML Response

- **Description**: The server sends back an HTML file in response to a client request. This is the traditional response type for rendering full web pages.
- **Use Case**: Used when a static or server-rendered page is requested, such as visiting a homepage or static blog page.
- **Advantages**:
  - SEO-friendly
  - Faster initial page load
  - Works without JavaScript

### Custom Response (JSON, XML, etc.)

- **Description**: Servers often send back custom responses like JSON or XML, particularly in APIs or when handling AJAX requests. These responses are typically structured data that frontends or other services use to render content dynamically.
- **Use Case**: Used in modern web applications and APIs to send data back to the client without rendering a full page, often consumed by JavaScript to update the UI dynamically.
- **Advantages**:
  - Lightweight and fast
  - Easy to parse and manipulate
  - Language-agnostic

### Binary Response

- **Description**: Servers can send binary data like images, videos, or downloadable files.
- **Use Case**: Used when serving media files or allowing file downloads.

### Status Code Only

- **Description**: Sometimes, servers only send an HTTP status code without any body content.
- **Use Case**: Used for redirects (3xx codes) or to indicate errors (4xx or 5xx codes) without additional information.

| **Response Type** | **Description**                                             | **Use Case**                             | **Content-Type Header**        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| HTML              | Server returns a full HTML document                         | Used for static or server-rendered pages | text/html                      |
| JSON              | Server returns structured data (JavaScript Object Notation) | Used in APIs or dynamic SPAs             | application/json               |
| XML               | Server returns structured data in XML format                | Older format used in data interchange    | application/xml                |
| Plain Text        | Server returns simple text                                  | Simple responses without structure       | text/plain                     |
| Binary            | Server returns binary data (e.g., images, files)            | Media files or downloads                 | application/octet-stream, etc. |

## 7. What is React Router DOM?

React Router DOM is a library that enables dynamic routing in React applications.
